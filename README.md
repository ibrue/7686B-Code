## Overview

Welcome to the official repository for team **7686B**â€™s final year (2023). Here you will find our code and notebook from the competition season. 
Fair warning: this repo is pretty unorganized, but it contains all of our work.

Uhh I don't know where the worlds code ended up, I'll upload it here at some point

I made some cool vision autoaim code based on Rocky's math, that's prob the most interesting part of the repo

We ended up winning the main competition, and we also gave the Skills Challenge our best shot.
